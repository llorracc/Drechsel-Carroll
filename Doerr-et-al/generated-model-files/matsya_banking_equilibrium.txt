# Banking Sector and Stationary Equilibrium in Doerr, Drechsel, Lee (2026)

## Preliminary Note on Sources

The research context provided contains fragments from several models — a directed technical change model with intermediate goods (the $Y_E$, $Y_L$ equations), the Carroll (2024) buffer stock saving model normalized by permanent income, a consumption-saving stage with lognormal income shocks, and a recursive competitive equilibrium definition referencing Zhu (2013) and Cao (2016). **None of these fragments contain the specific Doerr, Drechsel, Lee (2026) banking sector equation, the variable $\Xi$, the deposit-lending spread mechanism, or the four-problem stationary equilibrium definition you describe.** The paper "Income Inequality and Job Creation" and its Section 5 GE model are not present in my available context.

What I can do is provide a careful, structured response that:
- Clearly distinguishes what **you have supplied in the question prompt** (which I treat as authoritative claims about the paper),
- What can be **connected to the available context** (the Aiyagari-style RCE structure, the Carroll buffer-stock household problem),
- And where I must be **transparent about reconstruction versus direct sourcing**.

## 1. The Banking Sector in Detail

### 1.1 Zero-Profit Condition (Equation 19)

From your description, the banking sector is characterized by a **perfectly competitive, zero-profit intermediation technology**:

$$\boxed{R_\ell = R_d + \frac{\Xi}{D_{t+1}}}$$

where:

| Symbol | Definition |
|--------|-----------|
| $R_\ell$ | Gross lending rate charged to private-sector firms |
| $R_d$ | Gross deposit rate paid to households |
| $\Xi$ | Fixed (per-period) intermediation cost of operating the banking sector |
| $D_{t+1}$ | Aggregate deposits supplied by households |

**Structure of the bank's problem:**

The representative bank (or competitive banking sector) operates as follows each period:

1. **Liability side:** Collects deposits $D_{t+1}$ from households, promising gross return $R_d$
2. **Asset side:** Extends loans to private-sector firms — specifically:
   - Working capital loans: $\tilde{\phi}$ fraction of wage bills
   - Entry/fixed cost loans: $\tilde{\phi}_e$ fraction of fixed and entry costs
3. **Cost:** Incurs a fixed intermediation cost $\Xi > 0$ (independent of scale)
4. **Zero profit:** Competition drives profits to zero, yielding Equation 19

The bank's profit function is:

$$\pi^{bank} = R_\ell \cdot L^{bank} - R_d \cdot D_{t+1} - \Xi = 0$$

where $L^{bank}$ is total lending. Combined with the loan market clearing condition $L^{bank} = D_{t+1}$, this gives:

$$R_\ell \cdot D_{t+1} - R_d \cdot D_{t+1} - \Xi = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad R_\ell = R_d + \frac{\Xi}{D_{t+1}}$$

**Key features:**
- **No default risk:** The bank faces no credit risk on its loans — private firms always repay
- **No equity:** The bank is purely pass-through; all lending is deposit-funded
- **Fixed cost, not proportional:** $\Xi$ is a lump-sum cost, not a spread — this is the critical modeling choice

### 1.2 Loan Market Clearing

Total bank lending must equal total borrowing by private firms:

$$D_{t+1} = \tilde{\phi} \cdot W^{priv} + \tilde{\phi}_e \cdot FC$$

where $W^{priv}$ represents aggregate private-sector wage bills and $FC$ represents aggregate fixed/entry costs requiring financing. The parameters $\tilde{\phi}$ and $\tilde{\phi}_e$ capture the fraction of these costs that must be financed through bank credit (a working-capital constraint).

## 2. The Amplification Mechanism: How $\Xi/D$ Creates Endogenous Credit Spreads

This is the **central theoretical contribution** connecting the three-paper arc (Carroll 2000a,b → Doerr, Drechsel, Lee 2026):

### 2.1 The Mechanism in Three Steps

**Step 1: Rising Top Incomes → Increased Deposits**

From the household side — which, per your description, connects to the Carroll (2000a,b) buffer-stock framework — households with heterogeneous income face a consumption-saving problem. The context provides the normalized version:

> Normalizing by permanent income reduces the state from two variables $(\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{P})$ to one $(m = \mathbf{m}/\mathbf{P})$, yielding a stationary single-stage problem suitable for EGM.

When income concentration rises (top incomes increase), high-income households — who have lower marginal propensities to consume — save a larger fraction. In the buffer-stock framework, these households are far above their target wealth ratio $m^*$, so incremental income flows predominantly into savings (deposits $d$). Aggregate deposits $D_{t+1} = \int d_i \, d\mu(i)$ **rise**.

**Step 2: Increased Deposits → Lower Credit Spreads**

Here is where Equation 19 delivers the amplification:

$$\text{Spread} \equiv R_\ell - R_d = \frac{\Xi}{D_{t+1}}$$

Since $\Xi$ is **fixed**, the spread is a **decreasing, convex function** of aggregate deposits:

$$\frac{\partial (R_\ell - R_d)}{\partial D_{t+1}} = -\frac{\Xi}{D_{t+1}^2} < 0$$

As $D_{t+1}$ rises, the per-unit intermediation cost falls — the fixed cost is amortized over a larger deposit base. This is **not** a risk channel; it is a pure **scale economy** in intermediation.

**Crucially, in general equilibrium, $R_d$ adjusts endogenously.** With more deposits chasing lending opportunities, $R_d$ falls (household returns on saving decline), but $R_\ell$ falls **even more** because the spread compresses. The lending rate relevant for private firms drops.

**Step 3: Lower Lending Rates → Reduced Job Creation**

This is the paradoxical and novel result. Lower $R_\ell$ should, in a frictionless model, stimulate private firm entry and hiring. But the mechanism works through **general equilibrium reallocation**:

### 2.2 Why the Fixed Cost $\Xi$ Matters (vs. Proportional Spread)

If instead the banking technology featured a **proportional** cost $R_\ell = (1+\xi) R_d$, the spread would be $\xi R_d$, and an increase in deposits would compress $R_d$ but the **ratio** $R_\ell/R_d$ would remain constant. The fixed-cost specification creates a **level** effect:

| Specification | Spread | Effect of ↑D |
|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Fixed cost: $\Xi/D$ | $R_\ell - R_d = \Xi/D$ | Spread **compresses** as D rises — amplification |
| Proportional: $\xi R_d$ | $R_\ell - R_d = \xi R_d$ | Spread moves with $R_d$ — no independent amplification |

The fixed-cost specification means that the **deposit supply channel** has independent bite: more deposits mechanically reduce the wedge between borrowing and lending rates, creating a channel from household saving behavior to firm-level credit conditions that would not exist with proportional intermediation costs.

## 3. Complete Stationary Equilibrium Definition

### 3.1 Objects of the Equilibrium

A **stationary recursive competitive equilibrium** consists of:

**Prices:**
- $R_d$: gross deposit rate
- $R_\ell$: gross lending rate  
- $R_k$: rental rate of capital (public sector)
- $w$: wage rate in the public (corporate) sector
- $\tilde{w}$: wage rate in the private sector

**Aggregate quantities:**
- $D$: aggregate deposits
- $K$: aggregate capital in the public sector
- $N^{pub}$: aggregate labor in the public sector
- $N^{priv}$: aggregate labor in the private sector
- Mass of active private firms, entry rate

**Distributions:**
- $\mu$: stationary distribution of households over individual states $(x, e)$ — assets and idiosyncratic productivity/income

**Decision rules:**
- Household: consumption $c(x,e)$, deposit $d'(x,e)$, capital $k'(x,e)$, labor supply
- Private firm: entry, hiring, production, borrowing
- Public firm: capital demand $K^d(R_k, w)$, labor demand $N^d(R_k, w)$

This structure parallels the RCE definition in the context:

> *"the next period state $\mu'$ and the set $\Theta(\mu, l(\mu, \cdot), s)$ is taken as given in the maximization problem and $\mu' = \Phi(\mu, h)$ (distribution consistency)"*

### 3.2 Equilibrium Conditions

**(a) Household Optimization:**
Each household solves a consumption-saving problem given prices $(R_d, R_k, w, \tilde{w})$. This is the buffer-stock problem from the Carroll (2000a,b) arc. From the context:

> The agent arrives with balance $b$, receives random income shock $z$, has market resources $m = Rb + z$, chooses consumption $c$, saves end-of-stage assets $a = m - c$.

In the full model, the household allocates savings between deposits $d'$ (earning $R_d$) and capital $k'$ (earning $R_k$), and supplies labor to either sector.

**(b) Private Firm Optimization:**
Each potential private entrepreneur solves an entry and production problem given $R_\ell$ (cost of borrowing for working capital and fixed costs) and $\tilde{w}$ (private-sector wage). The firm borrows $\tilde{\phi} \tilde{w} n + \tilde{\phi}_e \cdot f$ from the bank at rate $R_\ell$.

**(c) Public Firm Optimization:**
Representative public (corporate) firm maximizes profit given $R_k$ and $w$, choosing capital and labor:
$$\max_{K,N} F(K,N) - R_k K - w N$$

This connects to the context's first-order conditions from profit maximization, analogous to:
$$\gamma_E Y(t)^{1/\epsilon} Y_E(t)^{-1/\epsilon} = p_E(t)$$

though the specific functional form differs.

**(d) Banking Zero-Profit:**

$$R_\ell = R_d + \frac{\Xi}{D}$$

**(e) Labor Market Clearing:**

$$\int \mathbf{1}[\text{works in public sector}] \, d\mu = N^{pub} \quad (\text{public sector})$$
$$\int \mathbf{1}[\text{works in private sector}] \, d\mu = N^{priv} \quad (\text{private sector})$$

Total labor supply equals total labor demand across both sectors.

**(f) Capital Market Clearing:**

$$\int k'(x,e) \, d\mu(x,e) = K$$

The sum of household capital holdings equals aggregate public-firm capital demand.

**(g) Deposit Market Clearing:**

$$\int d'(x,e) \, d\mu(x,e) = D = \tilde{\phi} \tilde{w} N^{priv} + \tilde{\phi}_e \cdot FC^{agg}$$

Aggregate household deposits equal aggregate bank lending to private firms.

**(h) Goods Market Clearing:**

$$\int c(x,e) \, d\mu(x,e) + \delta K + \Xi = Y^{pub} + Y^{priv}$$

Aggregate consumption plus depreciation plus banking costs equals total output from both sectors.

**(i) Distribution Stationarity:**

$$\mu = \Phi(\mu, h)$$

The distribution $\mu$ is a fixed point of the law of motion induced by household decision rules and the stochastic process for idiosyncratic shocks. From the context: *"$\mu' = \Phi(\mu, h)$ (distribution consistency)"*.

### 3.3 Solution Algorithm

The solution follows **nested loops akin to Aiyagari (1994)**, as referenced in the context's discussion of the RCE:

```
OUTER LOOP: Guess prices (R_d, w, w̃)
│
├── Compute R_ℓ = R_d + Ξ/D (requires inner guess on D)
│
├── MIDDLE LOOP: 
│   ├── Solve public firm problem → K^d(R_k, w), N^d(R_k, w)
│   ├── Solve private firm problem → entry, hiring given R_ℓ, w̃
│   └── Solve banking problem → R_ℓ consistent with D
│
├── INNER LOOP: Solve household problem via EGM
│   │   (Buffer-stock problem, as in Carroll 2024 context:
│   │    normalized by permanent income,
│   │    single state variable m = 𝐦/𝐏)
│   │
│   ├── Compute decision rules c(m,e), d'(m,e), k'(m,e)
│   ├── Simulate or iterate on distribution μ
│   └── Compute aggregates: D = ∫d'dμ, K = ∫k'dμ, N^s
│
├── CHECK CLEARING CONDITIONS:
│   ├── Capital market: ∫k'dμ = K^d? → update R_k
│   ├── Deposit market: ∫d'dμ = bank lending? → update R_d
│   ├── Labor markets: labor supply = labor demand? → update w, w̃
│   └── Banking: R_ℓ = R_d + Ξ/D consistent? → update D
│
└── CONVERGED? → Stationary Equilibrium
```

The context notes the open theoretical questions surrounding this approach:

> *"Zhu (2013) provides a proof for a stationary RCE, however, the existence of an RCE away from the steady state remains an open question. See Cao (2016) for the latest progress."*

## 4. How the Four Problems Connect Through Prices

The four optimization problems are linked through a **price system** that forms a simultaneous system:

**Price linkages in detail:**

| Price | Determined by | Affects |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| $R_d$ | Deposit market clearing ($D^s = D^d$) | Household saving incentive, bank cost |
| $R_\ell$ | Banking zero-profit: $R_d + \Xi/D$ | Private firm borrowing cost, entry decision |
| $R_k$ | Capital market clearing ($K^s = K^d$) | Household portfolio allocation, public firm capital choice |
| $w$ | Public-sector labor market clearing | Household labor income, public firm labor cost |
| $\tilde{w}$ | Private-sector labor market clearing | Household labor income, private firm labor cost |

**The bank is the critical nexus:** It is the **only institution** that connects household saving decisions to private firm credit conditions. Without the bank, deposits and private firm finance would be disconnected. The fixed cost $\Xi$ ensures that the volume of deposits has a first-order effect on the lending rate.

## 5. Full Causal Chain: Rising Top Incomes → Reduced Job Creation

### 5.1 Step-by-Step Mechanism

**Step 1: Exogenous shift in income distribution**
- Top income shares rise (e.g., through changes in the idiosyncratic income process $e$)
- This shifts mass in the household distribution $\mu$ toward high-$(x,e)$ states

**Step 2: Portfolio response of high-income households**
- High-income households in the buffer-stock framework are **above** their target cash-on-hand ratio $m^*$
- Their marginal propensity to consume is low (approaching the permanent-income benchmark)
- Incremental income flows disproportionately into **deposits** $d'$
- From the context: the household's problem maps balance $b$ through $m = Rb + z$ to the consumption-saving decision, with $a = m - c$ as end-of-period assets

**Step 3: Aggregate deposit supply rises**
$$D = \int d'(x,e) \, d\mu(x,e) \quad \uparrow$$

**Step 4: Banking spread compresses**
$$R_\ell - R_d = \frac{\Xi}{D} \quad \downarrow$$

The lending rate $R_\ell$ falls (for given $R_d$), or equivalently, $R_d$ falls less than $R_\ell$.

**Step 5: General equilibrium reallocation — the crucial step**
- Lower $R_\ell$ should encourage private firm entry... **but**
- Lower deposit returns $R_d$ also mean lower $R_k$ (household portfolio substitution pushes capital returns down)
- Lower $R_k$ causes **public firms to demand more capital** $K^d \uparrow$
- More capital in the public sector raises the **marginal product of labor** in the public sector
- Public-sector labor demand rises → **wages $w$ rise**
- Through labor market linkages, private-sector wages $\tilde{w}$ also rise

**Step 6: Private firm entry margin**
- Private firms must borrow to finance working capital ($\tilde{\phi} \tilde{w} n$) and entry costs ($\tilde{\phi}_e f$)
- The **total cost of a hire** for a private firm involves both the wage $\tilde{w}$ and the financing cost $R_\ell \cdot \tilde{\phi} \tilde{w}$
- While $R_\ell$ fell, $\tilde{w}$ rose sufficiently that the **product $R_\ell \cdot \tilde{\phi} \tilde{w}$** increases or the **net present value of entry** declines
- Fewer entrepreneurs find it profitable to enter
- **Private firm creation falls → job creation falls**

**Step 7: Aggregate labor market composition shifts**
- Employment shifts from private sector (entrepreneurial, job-creating) to public/corporate sector
- Total employment may be relatively stable, but the **composition** changes
- Fewer new firms → less dynamism, less job creation at the extensive margin

### 5.3 The Role of Each Paper in the Three-Paper Arc

| Paper | Role in the Mechanism |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Carroll (2000a)** — "Why Do the Rich Save So Much?" | Provides the micro-foundation for Step 2: documents that high-income households have systematically lower MPCs, creating the saving-inequality link |
| **Carroll (2000b)** — Buffer stock theory | Provides the **household problem** technology: the consumption-saving framework (visible in the context as the normalized Bellman problem) that generates heterogeneous MPCs and aggregate deposit supply as a function of the income distribution |
| **Doerr, Drechsel, Lee (2026)** | Embeds the Carroll household in a GE model with the banking sector (Eq. 19) and two production sectors, showing that the deposit supply channel creates a **general equilibrium** mechanism from inequality to job creation |

## Important Caveat

I must emphasize that the specific equations, variable names, and mechanisms for the Doerr, Drechsel, Lee (2026) model — including Equation 19, the parameter $\Xi$, the four-problem structure, and the causal chain — are **reconstructed from the detailed description provided in your question**, not independently verified from documents in my available context. The connections to the Aiyagari-style RCE structure and the Carroll buffer-stock household problem are grounded in the research context fragments provided. If any details of the paper differ from what you've described, the analysis above would need corresponding revision.
