# Public Firm Bellman Problem (Equations 15–18)

## 1. State Space

The public firm's problem is characterized by a single exogenous state:

| State Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| $z$ | Idiosyncratic productivity, following a Markov process with autocorrelation $\rho_z$ and innovation std $\sigma_z$ |

Notably, the public firm carries **no endogenous state** across periods. Because it faces frictionless capital markets (no borrowing constraints, no bank dependence), its factor demands $K$ and $N$ are chosen **statically** each period conditional on $z$ and prices $(R_k, w)$. The continuation value depends only on the exogenous productivity draw $z'$.

## 2. Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| $K$ | Physical capital rented/purchased at market return $R_k$ |
| $N$ | Labor hired at wage $w$ |

Both are chosen each period to maximize current-period profits plus discounted continuation value.

---

## 3. Technology (Equation 15)

$$
Y = z \, K^{\theta} \, N^{\gamma - \theta}, \qquad 0 < \theta < 1, \quad \theta < \gamma \leq 1
$$

This is a **Cobb-Douglas** production function with:
- Capital elasticity $\theta$
- Labor elasticity $\gamma - \theta$
- Returns to scale parameter $\gamma$ (if $\gamma < 1$, decreasing returns to scale; if $\gamma = 1$, constant returns)

The parameterization with $\gamma$ governing the **sum** of factor elasticities is deliberate: it allows the model to nest both CRS ($\gamma = 1$) and DRS ($\gamma < 1$), where DRS is necessary for well-defined firm-level profits in equilibrium.

## 4. Full Bellman Equation (Equation 16)

$$
V(z) = \max_{K, N} \left\{ z \, K^{\theta} \, N^{\gamma - \theta} - (R_k + \delta - 1) K - w N \right\} + \beta_f (1 - \lambda) \, \mathbb{E}\left[ V(z') \,\big|\, z \right]
$$

**Term-by-term interpretation:**

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $z K^{\theta} N^{\gamma-\theta}$ | Gross output (revenue) |
| $(R_k + \delta - 1)K$ | User cost of capital: required return $R_k$ plus depreciation $\delta$ minus the undepreciated capital returned (i.e., the rental rate of capital is $R_k + \delta - 1$) |
| $wN$ | Wage bill |
| $\beta_f$ | Firm discount factor |
| $(1 - \lambda)$ | Survival probability; with probability $\lambda$ the firm exits exogenously |
| $\mathbb{E}[V(z') | z]$ | Expected continuation value under the Markov process for productivity |

**Critical structural observation:** Because the maximization problem inside the braces is **purely static** — neither $K$ nor $N$ appears in the continuation value — the Bellman equation **separates** into:

$$
V(z) = \pi^*(z) + \beta_f (1 - \lambda) \, \mathbb{E}[V(z') | z]
$$

where $\pi^*(z) \equiv \max_{K,N} \left\{ z K^{\theta} N^{\gamma-\theta} - (R_k + \delta - 1)K - wN \right\}$ is the **static profit function**. This is a key simplification relative to the private firm problem.

## 5. First-Order Conditions with Derivations

### FOC for Capital (Equation 17)

Taking the derivative of the period profit with respect to $K$ and setting it to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial K}\left[ z K^{\theta} N^{\gamma-\theta} - (R_k + \delta - 1)K - wN \right] = 0
$$

$$
\theta \, z \, K^{\theta - 1} \, N^{\gamma - \theta} - (R_k + \delta - 1) = 0
$$

$$
\boxed{R_k = \theta \, z \, K^{\theta-1} \, N^{\gamma-\theta} + 1 - \delta}
$$

**Interpretation:** The marginal product of capital $\theta z K^{\theta-1} N^{\gamma-\theta}$ equals the **net** user cost of capital $R_k - (1 - \delta)$. Equivalently, the gross return on capital $R_k$ equals the marginal product plus the undepreciated fraction. This is the standard neoclassical rental rate condition.

### FOC for Labor (Equation 18)

Taking the derivative with respect to $N$:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial N}\left[ z K^{\theta} N^{\gamma-\theta} - (R_k + \delta - 1)K - wN \right] = 0
$$

$$
(\gamma - \theta) \, z \, K^{\theta} \, N^{\gamma - \theta - 1} - w = 0
$$

$$
\boxed{w = (\gamma - \theta) \, z \, K^{\theta} \, N^{\gamma - \theta - 1}}
$$

**Interpretation:** The wage equals the marginal product of labor. Since public firms are competitive in the labor market, this pins down labor demand given $(z, K, w)$.

### Deriving Optimal Factor Demands

From equations (17) and (18), we can solve for the **optimal factor demands** as functions of prices and productivity. Dividing the FOC for capital by the FOC for labor:

$$
\frac{R_k + \delta - 1}{w} = \frac{\theta}{(\gamma - \theta)} \cdot \frac{N}{K}
$$

$$
\frac{K}{N} = \frac{\theta}{(\gamma - \theta)} \cdot \frac{w}{R_k + \delta - 1}
$$

Substituting back into either FOC yields closed-form expressions for $K^*(z)$ and $N^*(z)$, and consequently the **profit function**:

$$
\pi^*(z) = \Phi \cdot z^{\frac{1}{1-\gamma}}
$$

where $\Phi$ is a constant depending on $(\theta, \gamma, R_k, \delta, w)$. When $\gamma < 1$ (DRS), this is well-defined and finite. When $\gamma = 1$ (CRS), profits are zero in equilibrium.

## 6. Comparison with the Private Firm Problem

This comparison is the **heart of the model's mechanism**:

| Dimension | Public Firm | Private Firm |
|---|---|---|
| **Capital access** | Frictionless capital markets; obtains $K$ at market rate $R_k$ | **Bank-dependent**; must borrow from banks at lending rate $R_\ell$ |
| **Financing cost** | User cost is $R_k + \delta - 1$ | User cost is $R_\ell + \delta - 1$, where $R_\ell > R_k$ due to banking intermediation spread |
| **Borrowing constraints** | None — can rent any $K$ at the market price | Potentially constrained by bank credit supply; collateral/leverage constraints may bind |
| **State space** | Only exogenous $z$ (static factor choice) | Likely includes endogenous net worth/assets $a$ alongside $z$, because borrowing constraints create intertemporal linkages |
| **Bellman separability** | Static profit + discounted continuation (fully separable) | Dynamic: current borrowing/saving decisions affect future collateral and hence future borrowing capacity |
| **Exit** | Exogenous at rate $\lambda$ | Same exogenous exit at rate $\lambda$ (same Markov process $\rho_z, \sigma_z$) |
| **Demand for bank loans** | **Zero** — no bank dependence | Positive — constitutes bank loan demand |
| **Sensitivity to deposit supply** | **Indirect only** — through general equilibrium $w$ | **Direct** — when deposits fall, $R_\ell$ rises, crushing private firm investment |

**What public firms have that private firms lack:**
- Direct access to capital markets at the household-determined rate $R_k$
- No balance sheet constraints; factor demands are purely static

**What private firms have that public firms lack:**
- Nothing advantageous — the asymmetry is one of **disadvantage**: private firms must use costly, constrained bank intermediation

## 7. Connection to the Household Problem via $R_k$

The public firm's FOC for capital (equation 17) directly determines the **equilibrium return on capital** $R_k$, which is the return households earn on their **capital investment** $k$:

$$
R_k = \theta \, z \, K^{\theta-1} N^{\gamma - \theta} + 1 - \delta
$$

In the household's portfolio problem, households allocate wealth between:

| Asset | Return | Intermediated by |
|---|---|---|
| **Deposits** $d$ | $R_d$ (deposit rate) | Banks → lent to private firms at $R_\ell > R_d$ |
| **Capital investment** $k$ | $R_k$ (capital return) | Direct → funds public firm capital |

The household's Euler equations for both assets must hold in equilibrium. The **non-homothetic preferences** (with $\eta > \sigma$) imply that as top incomes rise, wealthy households shift portfolios toward capital $k$ and away from deposits $d$ (because deposits are associated with safe/liquid motives that are less valued at higher wealth when $\eta > \sigma$).

The general equilibrium link is:

$$
\text{Household capital supply} \xrightarrow{k} \text{Public firm capital demand} \xrightarrow{R_k} \text{Household Euler equation}
$$

Public firms are price-takers at $R_k$; the aggregate demand for capital from public firms, combined with household capital supply, clears the capital market.

## 8. Why the Financing Asymmetry Is Central to the Model

The **entire transmission mechanism** of the paper flows through this asymmetry:

### Why Both Firm Types Are Necessary

1. **Without public firms**, there would be no outside option for household savings — deposits would be the only vehicle, and the portfolio reallocation channel would not exist.

2. **Without private firms**, there would be no bank-dependent sector to suffer from deposit withdrawal, and rising inequality would have no effect on credit conditions.

3. **The wedge $R_\ell - R_k$** is endogenous and **widens** as inequality rises: this is the banking spread that reflects the scarcity of deposits. Public firms' Bellman (equation 16) is benchmarked at $R_k$; private firms face $R_\ell > R_k$, and the gap grows precisely when top incomes drain the deposit base.

4. **The public firm problem is deliberately simple** — its static separability and frictionless access mean it serves as the **benchmark** against which private firm distortions are measured. The public firm Bellman's simplicity is a modeling feature, not a bug: it isolates the **bank-dependence channel** as the sole source of real effects from inequality-driven portfolio shifts.

### Connection to Carroll (2000a,b) Arc

The three-paper arc with Carroll's work on buffer-stock saving and consumption connects through the **non-homothetic preference structure**: Carroll's models establish that consumption and saving behavior differs qualitatively across the wealth distribution. Doerr, Drechsel & Lee embed this insight in general equilibrium where the *composition* of saving (deposits vs. capital), not just its level, matters — and the public firm Bellman (with its direct capital market access at $R_k$) is the asset that absorbs the portfolio shift away from deposits.
