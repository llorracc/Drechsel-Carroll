# "Why Do the Rich Save So Much?" — Carroll (2000)

## The Paper

Carroll (2000) argues that the saving behavior of the richest households cannot be explained by standard Life Cycle or Dynastic models in which wealth exists solely to finance future consumption. The paper marshals evidence from the SCF, the Forbes 400, and a focus group of wealthy individuals to conclude that the simplest consistent model is one with a "capitalist spirit" motive — either wealth is intrinsically desirable, or it yields a flow of services (power, status, security) that make it behave as though it were.

The key formal device is a direct utility-of-wealth term appended to the standard objective. This makes the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth decline at high wealth levels, generating the high saving rates observed in the upper tail.

## Literature Building on This Paper

### Empirical Foundations

- **Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2004)** — "Do the Rich Save More?" (*JPE*). Provides the definitive empirical confirmation that saving rates rise with lifetime income. Their evidence points toward precautionary and bequest motives rather than non-homothetic time preferences alone, but the fact pattern they establish is what Carroll's paper set out to explain.

- **Fagereng, Holm, Moll, and Natvik (2019)** — "Saving Behavior Across the Wealth Distribution" (*NBER WP 26588*). Uses Norwegian administrative data to decompose saving into active saving and "saving by holding" (retaining capital gains). Net of capital gains, saving rates are roughly flat; gross rates rise steeply with wealth because the rich hold appreciating assets. This reframes the puzzle: the rich may not actively save more, but their portfolios appreciate more.

### Bequest Motives and Wealth Concentration

- **De Nardi (2004)** — "Wealth Inequality and Intergenerational Links" (*REStud*). Builds an OLG model with voluntary bequests and intergenerational earnings transmission. The bequest motive, which operates much like Carroll's utility-of-wealth term at the end of life, is essential for generating realistic wealth concentration in the upper tail. This became the workhorse framework for quantitative wealth distribution models.

- **De Nardi, French, and Jones (2010)** — "Why Do the Elderly Save?" (*JPE*). Estimates that a bequest motive (luxury good, in Carroll's sense) plus medical expense risk are jointly needed to explain the slow asset decumulation of wealthy retirees — a fact that pure life-cycle models cannot match.

### Non-Homothetic Preferences and Macro Implications

- **Straub (2019)** — "Consumption, Savings, and the Distribution of Permanent Income" (*Harvard WP*). Directly operationalizes the insight that saving rates rise with permanent income by introducing non-homothetic preferences into a precautionary-saving model. Estimates that working-life consumption is concave in permanent income (elasticity ≈ 0.7). Shows that rising permanent income inequality since the 1970s has lowered real interest rates by ~1pp and raised the wealth-to-GDP ratio by ~30%. This is perhaps the most direct descendant of Carroll (2000) in modern macro.

- **Mian, Straub, and Sufi (2021)** — "The Saving Glut of the Rich" (*NBER WP 26941*). Documents that saving by the top 1% surged by 3pp of national income from the 1960s–70s to the post-2000 era. These savings were channeled into claims on government and household debt rather than productive investment. The non-homotheticity in portfolios — rich households accumulate financial claims while poorer households borrow — is the Carroll mechanism writ large in flow-of-funds data.

- **Mian, Straub, and Sufi (2021)** — "Indebted Demand" (*QJE*). Formalizes how the saving glut of the rich depresses aggregate demand and the natural rate of interest, creating a "debt trap." The mechanism relies on heterogeneous MPCs across permanent income — exactly the non-homotheticity Carroll (2000) identified.

### The Deposit Channel: From Portfolios to Job Creation

- **Doerr, Drechsel, and Lee (2026)** — "Income Inequality and Job Creation." Takes the non-homotheticity one step further: rich households not only save more, they save *differently* — more in stocks and bonds, less in bank deposits. Rising top income shares thus drain deposits from the banking system, raising loan rates for bank-dependent (private) firms and reducing their employment. Their model uses a non-homothetic deposit utility — a separate CRRA term over deposits with curvature η > σ — that is a direct formalization of Carroll's insight that the composition, not just the level, of wealthy households' savings matters for the real economy.

### HANK Models and Heterogeneous Portfolios

- **Kaplan, Moll, and Violante (2018)** — "Monetary Policy According to HANK" (*AER*). Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian models with liquid and illiquid assets generate realistic wealth distributions and MPCs. The two-asset structure inherits the insight that portfolio composition varies with wealth — deposits (liquid) vs. capital (illiquid) — which is the micro foundation Carroll gestured toward.

- **Auclert and Rognlie (2020)** — "Inequality and Aggregate Demand." Quantifies how income redistribution affects output through MPC heterogeneity. Long-run effects depend on whether inequality stems from permanent income dispersion (Carroll's domain) or transitory risk.

### Theoretical Refinements

- **Ma and Toda (2021)** — "A Theory of the Saving Rate of the Rich" (*JET*). Shows that high saving rates of the rich can emerge even with *homothetic* CRRA preferences, because consumption functions are asymptotically linear with low MPCs for the wealthy. This provides a partial counterpoint: some of the behavior Carroll attributed to non-homotheticity may arise from standard precautionary motives at extreme wealth levels.

## Conceptual Arc

Carroll (2000) posed the question and proposed the answer: the rich save so much because wealth itself yields utility (or utility-like services). The subsequent literature has:

1. **Confirmed the fact pattern** empirically (Dynan et al.; Fagereng et al.)
2. **Formalized the mechanism** via non-homothetic preferences in quantitative macro (Straub; Mian-Straub-Sufi)
3. **Extended it to portfolios** — not just *how much* but *how* the rich save (Doerr-Drechsel-Lee; Kaplan-Moll-Violante)
4. **Traced the macro consequences** — secular stagnation, indebted demand, declining business dynamism, and falling labor shares — all flowing from the simple observation that wealthy households' relationship to saving is qualitatively, not just quantitatively, different.
